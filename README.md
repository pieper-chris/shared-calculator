## Background

This app was created using Django and deployed to Heroku. You may notice the high amount of commits - 122 of them were related to deployment! Since I am new to integrating a Django project to Heroku, it took me a little longer to configure the settings and file structure to meet the requirements of a successful Heroku deployment. A possible solution to the frequent commits would be to perform a ```git rebase``` and ```squash``` the deployment process together. However, I am keeping all commits as they are for the full visibility of my process as you inspect my source code. 

### Future Work
There exist redundant files in my file structure. This mostly appeared well after my local app (Django only) worked beautifully on my local machine; folders needed to be moved around for Heroku deployment to be built successfully. In total, the file structure and commit history can be cleaned up, as it does seem a bit messy to me.

In the meantime, this application is up and working well - Thank you for this opportunity!
